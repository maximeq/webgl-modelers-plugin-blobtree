 *  The internal blobtree model of the modeler, in the MVC architecture.

 *  - the geometry computed from it. This could have been in the view, but since
 *    it is closely linked to the corresponding blobtree, it is kept here.
 *
 *  Can be extended with more geometries.
 *
 *  Events
 *      - gStatusChanged launched when a model geometry is changed.
